# tuneout
An apple script that writes iTunes song and artist information to a text file for use with the "text-from-file" feature of OBS streaming software.  TuneOut and OBS, used together, will display iTunes now-playing information during a stream.

1. Open iTunes
2. Play a song.
3. Run the TuneOut applescript.
4. Create or Select a text file to use.
5. Create a text source in OBS and select Text-From-File
6. Browse to the file you created from iTunes in step 4. 
7. Format the text as you like!

WARNING - Don't select the wrong file in step 4.  This script clears the file contents and rewrites them. 

To change "refresh rate" you can change the delay in the script.
